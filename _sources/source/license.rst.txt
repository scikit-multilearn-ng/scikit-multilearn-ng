GPL library dependency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the sub-functionalities of the library uses and depends on GPL-licensed libraries:

- :mod:`skmultilearn.cluster.graphtool` depends on GPL licensed python-graphtool_ module for Stochastic Blockmodel functionality
- :mod:`skmultilearn.cluster.igraph` depends on GPL licensed python-igraph_ module for community detection methods

Using any of these modules incurs GPL on your codebase, thus for commercial purposes for network-based label space division
you should be using the :mod:`skmultilearn.cluster.networkx` module which is depends on the well known BSD-licensed liibrary NetworkX_.

Note that none of these libraries are installed by default.
